<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>This program acts as a way of storing data about one's family (or any group of people, for that matter). 
It takes an integer input for how many people will be entered into the makeshift 'database.' For each family member, the user will 
be prompted to enter a name, age and hobby. As each family member is added to the database, the program will reiterate it to the
user so the user can see what has been entered. After every member has been added to the database, the program will automatically tell you who each member is and give their name, age and hobby. </p>
        
<h3>How you can use it</h3>

<p>To use this program, you need to have JupyterLab installed and ready to use. Copy and paste the link to the GitHub Repository (see below) and run the command "git clone 'link' ". This should create a new folder with all of the necessary files inside. Navigate to program_ctf16.ipynb. Nothing additional needs to be imported to use this program. To use it, simply run the first code cell and follow the on-screen instructions. If the program prompts you to "please try again," you will need to run the program again from scratch (on JupyterLab, press Shift+Enter)</p>
